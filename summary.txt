üìù Summary: What This Script Does
This Python script automates the process of retrieving court case details from the Indian eCourts portal using a CNR number. Here's how it works:

üîπ Step-by-Step Workflow
Launches a Chrome browser using Selenium with custom settings to allow automatic PDF downloads.

Navigates to the eCourts portal and selects the CNR Number search option.

Inputs a specific CNR number to search for a case.

Waits for the user to manually solve the CAPTCHA, which is required to access case details.

After CAPTCHA verification, it loads the case page and uses BeautifulSoup to:

Extract all visible tables from the page (e.g., case details, FIR info, parties, history, orders).

Convert each table into a structured format.

Saves the extracted data in two formats:

A JSON file (case_tables.json) for structured data storage.

A PDF file (case_tables.pdf) that presents all tables in a readable format.

‚úÖ Output
case_tables.json: Contains all table data in structured JSON format.

case_tables.pdf: A printable summary of all case tables.
